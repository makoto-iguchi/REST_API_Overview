# How to write the overview structure template:
#
# 1. Follow YAML format (http://www.yaml.org/)
# 2. There are two schema.
#   * section

# 3. The root will be a sequence of "section" schema.
# 4. Each "section" schema has the following mapping elements:

#   * desc: the section description (Optional. Will be treated as an empty if not specified)
#   * sections: a sequence of sub-sections (optional)
#   * methods: a sequence of methods to be described in the section (optional)
# 5. Each "method" schema has the following mapping elements:
#   * path: the path to the resource (mandatory)
#   * method: HTTP method of the resource (mandatory)
#   * desc: the method description (optional.  Will try to fetch from the WADL if not specified)

# Memo:
